This thesis has been a significant undertaking, and I am deeply grateful to the people who have supported me in this process. To my friends and family, I appreciate your kindness as I have grown increasingly fixated on this niche topic. Thank you for listening as I talked through many of my ideas---the good ones and the bad ones. To the Williams Computer Science Department, thank you for the institutional support that made this thesis possible, as well as the wonderful community you have all provided. To my thesis advisors, Mark and Jeannie, thank you for being the best advisors I could ask for, encouraging my creativity, giving me support and guidance when I needed it, and helping me get to the finish line of this project. And to everyone else in my life who I have not yet mentioned, thank you for helping me at every stage to grow into the person I am today.
