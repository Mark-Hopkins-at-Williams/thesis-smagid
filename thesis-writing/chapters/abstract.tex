Over the past forty years, surprisingly little progress has been made on user font selection. Whereas the number of fonts available to users has increased by several orders of magnitude, the font selection interface of almost every major word processor and design tool has remained the same: an scrollable, alphabetized list of font names. This interface does not provide users with any ability to search for fonts based on style---a problem since users often look for fonts matching certain style characteristics---and is an increasingly unfeasible method of search as the number of available fonts continues to increase. This project attempts to address this problem, hypothesizing that training autoencoder-like neural networks on font image data will yield meaningful quantitative style encodings for typefaces, upon which useful font selection interfaces can be built. We implement three models of increasing complexity---our Basic Autoencoder model, a Style Transfer model incorporating vector character embeddings as model input, and a model adapted from Srivatsan et al.\ \cite{srivatsan2020} which utilizes convolution and variational encoding---and find that the model adapted from Srivatsan et al.\ and trained on our full dataset is highly capable of representing a wide variety of typeface styles. We implement an end-to-end font selector webapp based on these model style encodings, and find preliminary results in a small user study suggesting that our user tool based on the model style encodings effectively allows users to locate and select fonts based on style characteristics.
