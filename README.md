# Typeface Space (Honors Thesis)

Welcome to the repository for Typeface Space. This research is the honors thesis work of Sam Magid, advised by Professors Jeannie Albrecht and Mark Hopkins at Williams College. We spent the Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 semesters researching the possibility of using autoencoder-based models to quantify the style of typefaces, in order to build style-based tools for font selection. You can find a prototype webapp font selector based on my research [here](http://sysnet.cs.williams.edu/~25sm39/).
